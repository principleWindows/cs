# Introduction to the MVVM Toolkit

<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/communitytoolkit/mvvm/introduction>

***************************************************

The `Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm` package (aka MVVM Toolkit) is a modern, fast, 
and modular MVVM library. It is part of the Windows Community Toolkit and is 
built around the following principles:
- Platform and Runtime Independent - .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 5 🚀 (UI 
Framework Agnostic)
- Simple to pick-up and use - No strict requirements on Application structure 
or coding-paradigms (outside of 'MVVM'ness), i.e., flexible usage.
- À la carte - Freedom to choose which components to use.
- Reference Implementation - Lean and performant, providing implementations 
for interfaces that are included in the Base Class Library, but lack concrete 
types to use them directly.
